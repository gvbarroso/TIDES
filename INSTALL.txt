Dependencies:
- A C++ compiler, both gcc and clang should work. Recent versions are required, with support for C++17.
- CMake >= 3.1 for building
- The Boost C++ libraries (versions 1.66 to 1.71, available in https://www.boost.org/).
- The Threads library (usually provided along with the C++ compiler installation).

Installation of TIDES:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local .. (for a local install)
make
make install

It is possible to generate a static executable, with all dependencies imbeded, so that it can be copied to a remote computer / cluster:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local -DBUILD_STATIC=ON ..
make
make install

The 'tides' executable will then be copied in $HOME/.local/bin .

On a standard linux workstation, TIDES takes ~ 2 minutes to compile and install once all dependencies are met.



NOTE ABOUT COMPUTING CLUSTERS:

It is possible that the default versions of gcc and cmake on computing clusters will not meet the aforementioned requirements.
To fix this, one can execute, e.g.,

module load gcc/9.3.0

module load cmake/3.7.2

in the interactive session that is used to build TIDES.

I have also noticed that cmake may have problems finding the Boost installation when working on a cluster.
To work around this problem one can execute (from the external build directory):

ccmake ..

then press "t" to enter "advanced" mode and edit the BOOST lines at the top of the GUI by pressing "enter" and enter the correct path.

then press "c" to configure and "g" to generate the make file. If the make file is generated successfully, one can then run "make install".

Once the Boost libraries are eventually found by cmake, compiling TIDES on a cluster may throw several warnings regarding Boost, but they can be ignored.

Yet another approach to running TIDES on a cluster is to generate a static executable on your local machine (see above), but some clusters have an outdated kernel and will throw the following error when executing tides: "FATAL: Kernel too old."
